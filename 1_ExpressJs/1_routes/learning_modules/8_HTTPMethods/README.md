# Other HTTP Methods

HTTP Protocol defines a number of different method verbs with many use cases. So far, we have been using the GET request which is probably the most common of all. Every time your browser loads an image, it is making a GET request for that file!

This course will cover three other important HTTP methods: PUT, POST, and DELETE. Express provides methods for each one: app.put(), app.post(), and app.delete().

PUT requests are used for updating existing resources. In our Express Yourself machine, a PUT request will be used to update the name or emoji of an expression already saved in our database. For this reason, we will need to include a unique identifier as a route parameter to determine which specific resource to update.
